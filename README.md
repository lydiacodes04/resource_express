# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The What to Wear(WTWR) back-end project utilizes Express to create a server for the WTWR application. In this project, functionality is developed for users to set up an encrypted password using bcryptjs. Different users are stored and are each assigned a unique user id. Users are able to add or delete items on their own accounts without impacting the accounts of others. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

This app is a fullstack application, utilizing React for the frontend, working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. It utilizes a custom-made backend, which uses Express.
